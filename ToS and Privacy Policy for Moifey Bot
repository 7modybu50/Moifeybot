ToS and Privacy Policy for Moifey Bot

Terms of Service
Anyone can use the bot in their servers.
If you somehow managed to break a rule in a server by using the bot, I am not responsible for it.
If you want to suggest a change or a feature, DM 7modybu50. Not all suggestions are going to be accepted.
Have fun using the bot, you are not allowed to not have fun.

Privacy Policy
The bot collects and saves the user ID of the requester (and the guildâ€™s ID for servers), so if you want your ID to be deleted, contact 7modybu50 to delete it manually.
